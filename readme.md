# Auth Example
I'm trying to make a very simple authentication application and trying to implement `Clean Architecture` into the application. The goal is to make the application as flexible as possible. Flexible in the sense that the application can be replaced using any database such as `Mongo DB` or `MySQL` or others by simply making the implementation of the database without changing the logical business code and so on. And also I try to make as many abstractions from the library as I use to make it more flexible.

And at the same time I did testing for the library that I just created [https://github.com/dwadp/mantau](https://github.com/dwadp/mantau) ðŸ˜†.
